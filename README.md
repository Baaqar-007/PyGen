# PyGen: Python Generative Models

Welcome to PyGen, a repository dedicated to exploring the versatility of Python as a programming language through various simulations and models. This repository serves as a testament to the power and flexibility of Python in handling complex systems and generating insightful simulations.

## Contents

1. **Brownian Motion for Asset Price Prediction**: This simulation uses the concept of Brownian motion, a random motion exhibited by particles in a gas or liquid, to predict asset prices. The unpredictability of Brownian motion mirrors the unpredictable nature of asset prices in the real world. This simulation uses the seaborn library for data visualization, providing a clear and intuitive representation of the asset price changes over time.

2. **Game of Life**: This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a zero-player game that demonstrates cellular automaton. The game takes place on an infinite two-dimensional grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead. The state of every cell changes from one generation to the next based on the states of its eight neighbors, following a set of rules originally defined by John Horton Conway in 1970.

3. **Molecular Simulation**: This simulation provides a dynamic visualization of molecular interactions. It uses the vispy library for high-performance interactive 2D/3D data visualization. This simulation can be used as a basis for more complex molecular dynamics simulations, such as protein folding or chemical reactions.

## Installation

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn vispy
```
